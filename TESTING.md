## Bugs

**Solved bugs:**

- Stripe webhook handler bug. I had to resort to an easier handling of my stripe payment system due to the meta data not being avaliable even though i debugged it for 6 hours straight. A working system is better than a broken one so i will consider it solved with an easier handling system. 



**Unsolved bugs:**

- Wishlist heart bug. For some reason, the heart is clickable when not signed in even though it is user authenticated in the code. The simple fix to this is removing the heart and replacing it with something telling the user that they have to sign in to wishlist.

- The dropdowns in the nav does not respond as fluently as they should which can result in stuttering when trying to press the subcategories. Needs to be fixed.

- Image size bug. The image sizes are loading incorrectly due to them not having a set size, this causes bad performance and needs to be addressed.

- Hamburger menu flexbox bug. The hamburger does not stay where it should and places itself a little bit out of the screen.

## Validation

### HTML Validation:
- No errors or warnings for my custom HTML code were found when passing through the official [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator. This checking was done manually by copying the view page source code (Ctrl+U) and pasting it into the validator.
- The only errors that are present are those from the bootstrap styling which i after many attempts could not resolve. I could resolve some but not all. I see the code as passing since bootstrap is encouraged but come with this downside.

### CSS Validation:

- [Css valdation - Auth](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Css valdation - Base](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Css validation - Cart](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Css validation - Checkout](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Css validation - Products](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Css validation - Product details](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)

- No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official [W3C (Jigsaw)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri) validator except for the warnings about the use of css root variables and webkits for the box-shadow. However, css code works perfectly on various devices.

### JS Validation:

- [Hamburger menu](documentation/validation/js-val/hamburger-val.png)
- [Stripe elements](documentation/validation/js-val/stripe-elements-val.png)
- [Hamburger menu](documentation/validation/js-val/wishlist_icon-val.png)

- No errors or warning messages were found when passing through the official [JSHint](https://www.jshint.com/) validator. However, to validate js full `/* jshint esversion: 8, jquery: true, scripturl: true */` was added to the top of the file.

### Python Validation:

- No errors were found when the code was passed through Valentin Bryukhanov's [online validation tool](http://pep8online.com/). According to the reports, the code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator.
